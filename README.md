# simple-web-app

The assignment was to provide a small web project:
* The web project should be a tomcat 6 deployable web application. Typically you'd provide a WAR. 
* The web project should consist of both a client and a server piece. (JAX-RS or JAX-WS)
* A user should browse to a setup page (jsp/jsf/or servlet) where tables in a MySQL database will be created and then populated with 5-10 rows of sample data each.
* There should be 3 simple 3-6 column tables representing customers, orders and products. 
* Database access should use hibernate.
* Once the setup is completed the user should be redirected to a view page(s) that will provide an attractive presentation of the sample data.
* Please comment the code explaining why you've written the code the way you have and feel free to discuss other ways you considered writing the code.
